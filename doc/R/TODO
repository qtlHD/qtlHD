For qtlHD we are going to create an R package that can be installed by users.

We want an R package which can (in principle) be part of CRAN, provided the
qtlHD binary support libraries are installed. The support libraries come
seperately, mostly because CRAN does not support D, at this moment.

The procedure is:

  1. Install qtlhd libraries (D!)
  2. Install R/qtlhd package (no D!)

Theoretically we could have the R package install the libraries, pulling them
from the Internet, but that is for the future.

The R/qtlhd package should only contain R code (optionally C), that wraps
the lowlevel API of qtlHD.

The R/qtlhd package should do no processing, only conversions to types that 
qtlHD can use.
